                <p class="main-text">The Artsey gallery and store was founded in 2014 as a passion project to enable amateur 
                    artist to sell their work, market their skills, and communicate with other artists. 
                    It has since then grown into a small yet sustainable business, providing bot a space to create and sell artwork. 
                    Occasionally we host exhibitions, workshops, and other community eventsâ€¦ so stay tuned.</p>
